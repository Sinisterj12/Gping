## Session H
### 2025-07-02: Project Reset and Convention Establishment
**Action Taken**: Reset the project to a known good state and established firm conventions for our workflow.
**Rationale**: Previous attempts to add the system tray feature resulted in a corrupted project state. A clean reset was necessary.

**Changes**:
- Restored the last known working version of `ping_tool.py` from a local backup.
- Reverted `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` to match the remote repository using `git restore`.
- Deleted the temporary `error.log` file.
- Created `gemini.md` to document project-specific conventions for dependency management, environment setup, and logging.

**Current Status**:
- The project is now in a clean, stable state, in sync with the remote repository.
- `ping_tool.py` is present locally but remains untracked by Git, as per the original state.
- `gemini.md` is in place to guide future actions.

### 2025-07-02: System Tray Implementation (Attempt 2)
**Action Taken**: Methodically implemented the system tray feature, following our new conventions.
**Rationale**: To add the system tray icon without introducing the previous blocking errors.

**Changes**:
1.  **Added Dependency**: Ran `uv add pystray` to correctly add the dependency to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
2.  **Modified `ping_tool.py`**:
    - Added `import pystray` and `from PIL import Image`.
    - Added a new `setup_system_tray` method to create and run the icon in a non-blocking, detached thread (`self.tray_icon.run_detached()`).
    - Modified the `on_closing` method to ensure the tray icon is properly stopped (`self.tray_icon.stop()`).
    - Scheduled the tray setup to run 100ms after the main GUI starts (`self.root.after(100, self.setup_system_tray)`) to prevent initialization conflicts.

**Next Step**: User will test the application to confirm the fix.

### 2025-07-02: Threading Fix and GitHub Sync (Claude)
**Issue Identified**: System tray setup was blocking main GUI thread during initialization
**Action Taken**: Fixed threading issue and synchronized with GitHub

**Changes**:
- Moved system tray initialization from `__init__` to end of GUI setup
- Fixed "Starting..." hang-up issue with 300ms DNS thread delay (from previous session)
- Restored missing CSV logging path fix

**GitHub Sync**:
- **Commit**: `3b35c5c` - "Fix threading race condition and add system tray support"
- Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub repository
- Local and remote repositories now fully synchronized

**Current Status**:
- âœ… App opens normally with system tray icon
- âœ… All threading issues resolved
- âœ… Project synced with GitHub
- Ready for minimize-to-tray behavior implementation

**Next Priority**: Implement minimize-to-tray functionality (hide window when minimized)

## Session I
### 2025-07-03: Project Organization and Fresh Build with UV
**Action Taken**: Organized project structure and created fresh executable build using UV
**Rationale**: Clean up old build artifacts and establish proper release management workflow

**Changes**:
1. **Version Management Setup**:
   - Created `v1.0.0` and `v0.9.0-legacy` Git tags
   - Successfully pushed tags to GitHub repository
   - Created first GitHub release for v0.9.0-legacy with executable upload

2. **Project Organization**:
   - Created `releases/` folder for version management
   - Moved legacy executable to `releases/GPing-v0.9.0-legacy.exe`
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `releases/` folder from Git tracking

3. **Clean Build Process**:
   - Removed old `dist/` folder and `GPing.spec` from pre-UV setup
   - Performed fresh build using `uv run pyinstaller` with proper UV environment
   - Successfully created `dist/GPing.exe` with system tray functionality

**UV Build Command Used**:
```powershell
uv run pyinstaller ping_tool.py --onefile --noconsole --icon=Gping.ico --name=GPing
```

4. **Testing and Release Preparation**:
   - Successfully tested new executable with all system tray functionality
   - Confirmed minimize-to-tray and restore operations working properly
   - Verified network disconnect/reconnect detection (ethernet unplug test)
   - Moved working executable to root directory for tcping.exe compatibility
   - Created `releases/GPing-v1.0.0.exe` for GitHub release upload

**Current Status**:
- âœ… Professional release folder structure established
- âœ… Legacy version properly tagged and uploaded to GitHub
- âœ… Fresh executable built with UV environment management
- âœ… System tray functionality fully tested and working
- âœ… v1.0.0 executable ready for GitHub release
- âœ… All core functionality verified: network monitoring, system tray, minimize/restore
- âœ… **Tag Cleanup**: Removed obsolete `JTool` tag from local and remote repositories
- âœ… **GitHub CLI Setup**: Added GitHub CLI to user PATH and authenticated successfully
- âœ… **v1.0.0 Release Complete**: GitHub release created with GPing-v1.0.0.exe (15.89 MiB)

**ðŸŽ‰ MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Both v0.9.0-legacy and v1.0.0 releases are now live on GitHub!

## Known Issues / Future Enhancements
### Immediate Priority:
- **Minimize-to-tray behavior**: X button should minimize to tray (not close) when monitoring is active
- **Settings persistence**: Save user preferences for ping intervals and notification settings

### Future Features:
- **Configurable ping intervals**: Allow users to set custom ping frequency
- **Sound alerts**: Audio notifications for connection loss/restore events
- **Enhanced logging**: Export capabilities and log filtering options
- **Multiple IP monitoring**: Support for monitoring additional custom IP addresses

### Development Notes:
- Use GitHub Issues to track individual bugs/features
- Create feature branches for major changes
- Test thoroughly before creating new releases
- Implemented GPING NEXT foundation: created async agent package (`gping_next/`) with runtime, probes, telemetry sinks, policy controls, logging, inventory collection, triggers, intent routing, and local UI bridge modules. Added CLI entrypoint for headless execution.
- Added documentation suite (`docs/ARCH.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DASHBOARD_UX.md`, `docs/CONSTRAINTS.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOT.md`) plus Apps Script stub and PowerShell deployment scripts.
- Wrote pytest coverage for logging cadence, watchlist policy, trigger handling, queue dedupe, and UI locking; updated README with GPING NEXT usage overview.
- Simplified task registry noop helper to avoid unnecessary `asyncio` dependency while keeping async signature.

### 2025-07-04: GPING NEXT polish for field testing
- Rewrote `README.md` with a non-technical quick-start, flaky-network guidance, and deployment checklist so store managers can self-test the agent.
- Expanded `/docs/TROUBLESHOOT.md` to cover repeated dropouts and how to react using watch mode plus SENDNOW triggers.
- Added `tests/test_telemetry.py` to prove the offline queue flushes once connectivity returns, protecting uploads after outages.
