## Session H
### 2025-07-02: Project Reset and Convention Establishment
**Action Taken**: Reset the project to a known good state and established firm conventions for our workflow.
**Rationale**: Previous attempts to add the system tray feature resulted in a corrupted project state. A clean reset was necessary.

**Changes**:
- Restored the last known working version of `ping_tool.py` from a local backup.
- Reverted `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` to match the remote repository using `git restore`.
- Deleted the temporary `error.log` file.
- Created `gemini.md` to document project-specific conventions for dependency management, environment setup, and logging.

**Current Status**:
- The project is now in a clean, stable state, in sync with the remote repository.
- `ping_tool.py` is present locally but remains untracked by Git, as per the original state.
- `gemini.md` is in place to guide future actions.

### 2025-07-02: System Tray Implementation (Attempt 2)
**Action Taken**: Methodically implemented the system tray feature, following our new conventions.
**Rationale**: To add the system tray icon without introducing the previous blocking errors.

**Changes**:
1.  **Added Dependency**: Ran `uv add pystray` to correctly add the dependency to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
2.  **Modified `ping_tool.py`**:
    - Added `import pystray` and `from PIL import Image`.
    - Added a new `setup_system_tray` method to create and run the icon in a non-blocking, detached thread (`self.tray_icon.run_detached()`).
    - Modified the `on_closing` method to ensure the tray icon is properly stopped (`self.tray_icon.stop()`).
    - Scheduled the tray setup to run 100ms after the main GUI starts (`self.root.after(100, self.setup_system_tray)`) to prevent initialization conflicts.

**Next Step**: User will test the application to confirm the fix.

### 2025-07-02: Threading Fix and GitHub Sync (Claude)
**Issue Identified**: System tray setup was blocking main GUI thread during initialization
**Action Taken**: Fixed threading issue and synchronized with GitHub

**Changes**:
- Moved system tray initialization from `__init__` to end of GUI setup
- Fixed "Starting..." hang-up issue with 300ms DNS thread delay (from previous session)
- Restored missing CSV logging path fix

**GitHub Sync**:
- **Commit**: `3b35c5c` - "Fix threading race condition and add system tray support"
- Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub repository
- Local and remote repositories now fully synchronized

**Current Status**:
- ✅ App opens normally with system tray icon
- ✅ All threading issues resolved
- ✅ Project synced with GitHub
- Ready for minimize-to-tray behavior implementation

**Next Priority**: Implement minimize-to-tray functionality (hide window when minimized)
